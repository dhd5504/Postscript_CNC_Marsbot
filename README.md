Problem Description:  

Using the MarsBot Tool in the MARS MIPS software to draw the words 'DCE', 'SoICT', and a custom shape (minimum 10 cuts).  
• Create a postscript with the structure `<motion angle>, <time>, <cut/no cut>` stored directly in the source code to draw the specified words.  
• The source code contains 3 postscripts, and the user uses the keys 0, 4, 8 on the Key Matrix of the Digital Lab Sim to select the postscript for processing:  
          + Key 0: The program will execute message1 (draw 'DCE')  
          + Key 4: The program will execute message2 (draw 'SoICT')  
          + Key 8: The program will execute message3 (draw 'I Love HUST') .
